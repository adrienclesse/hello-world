# hello-world

Hi, my name is Adrien Clesse. I'm 28 years old and since I graduated, I've been travelling a lot, working in different fields, learning languages and improving my skills in various fields. I'm very open minded and willing to leave my comfort zone, take new oportunities and do whathever I can to use my time the most efficient way I can.

Here is my first HTML creation and I'm going to explain through this website some of my motivations to start learning coding. I'm very pleased that you're reading it.
